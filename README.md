# text_summarization_and_extractive_question_answering
This is an exploration of the use of pre-trained LLMs for use in text summarization and extractive question answering.

## Overview
Large Language Models (LLMs) leverage deep learning and transformer architectures to handle massive datasets. They utilize millions or billions of parameters, enabling them to perform a wide variety of nuanced tasks. Some of their capabilites include text generation, translation, and summarization.

This report will examine a couple of these cabablities using pre-trained models from the Hugging Face library. First two models will be compared for their text summarization capabilities. Afterwards an extractive question answering model will be explored.
